# CND APP

### Overview
This app lets you enter your coordinates (lat long) to search an address on map .

### Hick-ups
- JSON call returns [Object Object]. Still need to work on how to access its keys and valuse.
- Need to install moon map instead of normal map.

### Next Steps
**Step 1:** Once i figure how to access JSON object's content, store all vehicles in a vehicles array as individual vehicle object.

**Step 2:** Access vehicle properties to list down all 6 vehicles in a dropdown menu and display their position based on the selected vehicle by user input.

**Step 3:** Replace normal map with moon map for the given co-ordinates to work.

**Step 4:** Unit testing.
